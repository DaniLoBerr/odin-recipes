# Asturian cuisine

This project consists of the creation of a recipe website with some typical dishes of Asturian cuisine.

It consists of a main HTML document, in which other HTML documents with the information of each recipe are linked, and a CSS document with the pages styles.

The aim of the project is to practice the basics of GIT, HTML and CSS learnt in the first lessons of the online curriculum of The Odin Project.
